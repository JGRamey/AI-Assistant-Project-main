Future Improvements & New Features

## To Be Reimplemented

### Directories

- **`src/core_platform/`**: This directory was intended to house the core business logic for various domains of the application, including analytics, content, finances, marketing, and social features.

### Files

- **`src/agents/journal_agent.py`**: An agent for managing a personal journal. It supported adding text and audio entries, with audio being stored in an S3 bucket and text in a local SQLite database. It also included a voice-to-text feature.
- **`src/blockchain.py`**: Contained a `SmartContractManager` class for interacting with Ethereum-based smart contracts. It was responsible for storing and retrieving encrypted data on the blockchain using `web3.py`.
- **`src/agents/learning_agent.py`**: An agent designed to learn and store user preferences in a local SQLite database.
- **`src/agents/crm_agent.py`**: This agent handled Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tasks. It could add and list contacts and send marketing campaigns, using Supabase for its database.
- **`src/agents/coding/smart_contract_ai_agent.py`**: An agent that utilized the `SmartContractManager` to interact with smart contracts, allowing for the storage and retrieval of data from the blockchain.
- **`src/agents/coding/snippet_agent.py`**: A simple agent for saving and managing code snippets in a local SQLite database.
- **`src/agents/sentiment_agent.py`**: An agent that performed sentiment analysis on text by making requests to the Grok API.

Additionally, we need to update the UI to allow users to visually manage their agents and tasks. Use slack, airtable, and supabase to create a database of agents and tasks. Or create knock-offs of these tools (excpect supabase) to implement on own platform
