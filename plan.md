Make sure all code has tests and is optimized.

Think of subdirectory names for AI Agents that aren't currently in subdirectories already.

Brainstorm AI Agents that could be added to the platform and add to the "Possible Future Agents" section in the README-AGENTS.md file. Add any new subdirectories to the README-AGENTS.md file if new agents don't fit into existing subdirectories.

Upgrade AI agents code to fully optimize them.

Add any additional AI Agents to the platform to achieve full functionality.

Implement SupaBase API key and other relevant API keys (GMAIl, Slack, Grok, etc.)

Start coding backend (connected to Supabase) and making tables for the Main Agent (AI Assistant) and AI Agents. See if GO can help with this and optimize Python code to make it run faster while maintaining functionality and efficiency.

Create "Management" area in UI/Frontend to manage the Main Agent (AI Assistant) and AI Agents. This area will allow users to create, update, and delete AI Agents with the ability to set the AI Agent's name, description, and allow to create, edit, and stop tasks/workflows for the AI Agents.

Integrate the voice agent into the main agent.

Integrate the notes agent into the main agent.

Integrate the learning agent into the main agent.

Integrate Windsurf AI into the coding agent.

Make sure the AI agents are able to communicate with the main agent (AI Assistant).

Integrate the AI Assistant into the frontend.

Integrate the AI Assistant into the backend.

Integrate the AI Assistant into the database.

Integrate the AI Assistant into the storage.
